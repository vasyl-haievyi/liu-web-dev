## Description

I want to make online market place where people can register as sellers or customers and trade. As a seller you will be able to create different items with description, photos etc. As a customer you will be able to buy items, leave feedback, communicate with sellers. Also, I want to implement some social network functionalities like chatting, having friends list, friends' updates wall etc. 

## Frameworks

I am going to use Go programming language and Gin framework for the backend because I would like to learn those instruments.

For the frontend I will use React, as this is going to be a quite small webapp and I probably do not need huge framework for it.

The rest of the frameworks and libraries will be chosen during the project implementation.
